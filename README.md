# CIFAR-10-Classification-Using-CNN-and-ANN

## AIM
The project aims at building a classification model for the provided CIFAR-10 dataset which is an image dataset. This is achieved by applying two classification approaches: Deep Learning with Convolution layer (CNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## DATA
The CIFAR-10 Dataset is an important image classification dataset. It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes (airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks), with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

## TOOLS
* Keras API
* TensorFlow
